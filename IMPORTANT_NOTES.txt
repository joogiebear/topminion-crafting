   IMPORTANT NOTES - TopMinion-Crafting
========================================

BUILD SUCCESSFUL!

JAR Location: TopMinion-Crafting-1.0.0.jar
Size: 17KB

========================================
   IMPORTANT: API COMPATIBILITY NOTE
========================================

This plugin was built for TopMinion v3, but the current dev build you provided
has a LIMITED API that doesn't expose ConfigMinionManager and ConfigUpgradeManager
through the normal API methods.

WORKAROUND IMPLEMENTED:
-----------------------
The plugin uses REFLECTION to access these managers directly from the TopMinion
plugin instance. This is a temporary workaround and works fine, but:

- It may break if TopMinion's internal structure changes
- It's not the "clean" way to use an API
- When the full v3 API is released, the code should be updated

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
✓ Plugin compiles successfully
✓ All features implemented
✓ Should work with your current TopMinion v3 dev build
✓ Uses reflection to access config managers
✓ Permission system is fully optional
✓ Excludes SKIN upgrades as requested

TESTING CHECKLIST:
------------------
1. Place TopMinion-Crafting-1.0.0.jar in plugins/ folder
2. Ensure TopMinion v3 is installed and working
3. Start server
4. Check that plugin loads without errors
5. Edit config.yml to match your TopMinion minion IDs
6. Run /topminioncrafting reload
7. Test crafting a minion
8. Test crafting an upgrade
9. Verify items are correct TopMinion items

KNOWN LIMITATIONS:
------------------
- Reflection may fail if TopMinion's field names change
- Some Java security managers might block reflection
- Debug mode recommended for troubleshooting

IF PROBLEMS OCCUR:
------------------
1. Enable debug mode in config.yml (settings.debug: true)
2. Check server console for detailed error messages
3. Verify TopMinion v3 is loaded (green in /plugins)
4. Check that minion_id matches exactly in TopMinion configs
5. Make sure the field names "configMinionManager" and
   "configUpgradeManager" exist in TopMinion main class

FUTURE UPDATE NEEDED:
---------------------
When TopMinion v3 full API is released with proper getter methods
like getConfigMinionManager() and getConfigUpgradeManager(),
update ItemUtil.java to remove reflection and use proper API methods.
